This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1:100)
plot(x)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(x)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Instruction
A summary of Markdown syntax is available when editing R Markdown documents
under RStudio, or on this [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://goo.gl/6ThPR7).


## Importing data

The following R code is based on the **first project**. Set the `WD`
variable to point to your *working directory* (assuming the data file can be
found there).

Without further option, the following code chunk will be printed and executed.

```{r load}
```

The following chunk will, however, not be displayed, but expressions will be
evaluated and results available for later use.

```{r mask, echo=FALSE}
library(xtable)  ## useful for displaying HTML table
```

## Overview

Here is a brief sketch of the data, number and type of variables, number of
observations, etc.

Tables can be created using base R commands, like `table()` or `xtabs()`,
and the [xtable](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable) package. We
just have to set the option `result='asis'`, and ask for HTML output when
calling `print.xtable()`, as illustrated in the next chunk.

```{r xtable, results='asis'}
print(xtable(head(iris)), type="html", include.rownames=FALSE)
```

The `xtable` package will also work with tables produced by `summary()` for
ANOVA and regression models.

Figures are displayed easily too, and there are various custom settings that
can be used, see the `knitr`
[Chunk options and package options](http://yihui.name/knitr/options). 

```{r xyplot, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
xyplot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data=iris, groups=Species, type=c("p", "g"))
```

Finally, external figures can be included using standard Markdown syntax:
`![alt label](filename)`.
